            <h5>Ghost Brokers</h5>
            Code
            A "Ghost Broker" is a term used to describe a fraudster who pretends to be a genuine Insurance Broker in order to sell
            fraudulent car insurance. Ghost broking scams have risen in recent years and typically take place on social media, but
            they can also be facilitated through word of mouth or local businesses.


            <h5>How the scam works</h5>
            Policies are bought from legitimate insurance companies using false information and then doctored before being sold on
            to customers. Fake policy documents designed to look like they have been issued by legitimate insurance companies are
            created and sold on to customers who are ultimately the victim of these scams.

            <h5>What are the consequences of driving without insurance?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your car may be seized and crushed by the police.</li>
                <li>You'll pay a fixed penalty notice of £300.</li>
                <li>You'll have to buy valid insurance and pay at least £150 to get your car back from the pound.</li>
                <li>You could face court where you might receive an unlimited fine and a driving ban. A criminal conviction can also impact
                job prospects.</li>
                <li>You could be liable to cover the costs of any injuries or damage caused if you cause a collision while driving without
                insurance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>How to beat the fraudsters</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Check the seller has a legitimate website, a UK phone number and address. <em>(I'm not sure how useful this is as there wsa a genuine website)</em> </li>
                <li>If buying through a broker or insurer, check they're registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/".>here</a></li>
                <li>If you have been approached or think you are a victim of this type of fraud contact the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/contact">FCA Consumer Helpline.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            We hope this helps you resolve the situation, again we are sorry about the circumstances and hope that Action Fraud (the
            Police) and the IFB will help with the issue.
